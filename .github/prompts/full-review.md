Perform a comprehensive code audit with the following detailed analysis criteria:

### 1. Architectural Review
- Evaluate the overall system architecture
- Identify potential architectural patterns or anti-patterns
- Assess the current separation of concerns
- Check for unnecessary dependencies between modules

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
- Analyze code complexity using cyclomatic complexity metrics
- Identify areas with high cognitive load or overly complex functions
- Review adherence to SOLID principles
- Check for code duplication and potential refactoring opportunities

### 3. Modularity and Abstraction Analysis
- Evaluate the current level of modularization
- Assess the granularity of modules and classes
- Check for appropriate use of interfaces and abstract classes
- Identify opportunities for improved encapsulation

### 4. Performance and Efficiency Evaluation
- Detect potential performance bottlenecks
- Analyze time and space complexity of critical algorithms
- Identify inefficient data structures or algorithms
- Review memory management and resource utilization

### 5. Code Maintainability Indicators
- Check code readability and consistency
- Evaluate naming conventions and code documentation
- Assess test coverage and testability of components
- Identify areas with high maintenance complexity

### 6. Security and Best Practices
- Scan for potential security vulnerabilities
- Check for proper error handling and exception management
- Review input validation and sanitization
- Assess compliance with coding standards and best practices

### 7. Scalability and Extensibility Assessment
- Evaluate the system's ability to handle increased load
- Identify potential scalability constraints
- Check for design patterns that support easy extension
- Assess the flexibility of the current architecture

### Specific Recommendations
For each identified issue, provide:
- Detailed description of the problem
- Potential refactoring strategies
- Estimated effort for improvement
- Potential impact on system performance and maintainability

Please generate a comprehensive report with actionable insights and prioritized recommendations for code improvement.
