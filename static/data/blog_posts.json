      "content": "# How the SYSGrow Irrigation System Works\n\nIrrigation should feel safe, predictable, and easy to understand. SYSGrow is built around that idea: it **checks**, **explains**, **executes safely**, and then **learns** from outcomes.\n\nThis guide walks you through the flow in plain language.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Detect\n\nEvery cycle starts with a soil moisture reading. Before the system does anything, it validates the data:\n\n- **Freshness:** stale readings are ignored\n- **Cooldown:** recent watering prevents repeated runs\n- **Manual mode:** if you’re in manual mode, the system only notifies you\n\nIf everything looks good and moisture is below the target threshold, it creates a **pending irrigation request**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Decide (Approval Flow)\n\nWhen a request is created, you’ll receive a notification to:\n\n- **Approve** (run at the scheduled time)\n- **Delay** (push it back)\n- **Cancel** (skip this run)\n\nThis keeps you in control even when automation is enabled.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Execute Safely\n\nWhen it’s time to run, SYSGrow uses a safety-first sequence:\n\n1. **Acquire unit lock** (prevents double watering)\n2. **Open valve** (if configured)\n3. **Start pump** (non-blocking)\n4. **Stop pump / close valve**\n\nIf a valve fails, the pump does **not** run. This protects your plants and equipment.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Verify the Outcome\n\nAfter watering, SYSGrow waits a short delay (to let water settle) and then captures a **post‑moisture reading**. This helps answer:\n\n- Did we add enough water?\n- Did we overshoot?\n- Is the sensor behaving strangely?\n\nThese results are stored as telemetry so you can see exactly what happened.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Learn from Feedback\n\nYou can submit feedback like:\n\n- **Too little**\n- **Just right**\n- **Too much**\n- **Triggered too early / too late**\n\nSYSGrow then decides whether to adjust **duration** (volume) or **threshold** (timing). This keeps improvements targeted and predictable.\n\n---\n\n## Manual Mode (Sensor‑Only)\n\nIf you don’t have a pump or valves, you can still benefit from guidance:\n\n- Log manual watering events\n- Capture pre/post moisture changes\n- Get a **predicted next irrigation time** based on dry‑down rate\n\nThis makes manual care smarter without forcing automation.\n\n---\n\n## Telemetry & Debugging\n\nIf something feels off, check the irrigation telemetry panel:\n\n- **Execution logs** show what ran and how long\n- **Eligibility traces** show why it ran or why it skipped\n- **Manual logs** show your own watering history\n\nThis makes troubleshooting transparent instead of guesswork.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Tips\n\n- Start with a **moderate threshold** and adjust gradually\n- Use **cooldown** to prevent back‑to‑back runs\n- Let the system collect a few cycles before changing too much\n\n---\n\nIf you ever want to tune settings or change your default schedule, head to **Settings → Irrigation**.\n\nYour plants will thank you.\n"

      "content": "# Understanding VPD: A Beginner's Guide\n\nIf you've been growing plants for a while, you've probably heard about VPD. But what exactly is it, and why do experienced growers consider it one of the most important metrics to monitor?\n\n## What is VPD?\n\nVPD stands for **Vapor Pressure Deficit**. In simple terms, it measures how \"thirsty\" the air is - or more technically, the difference between how much moisture the air could hold and how much it actually contains.\n\n### The Science (Simplified)\n\nWarm air can hold more water vapor than cold air. When air is completely saturated with water, we say it's at 100% relative humidity. VPD measures the gap between the current humidity and complete saturation.\n\n**Low VPD** = The air is nearly saturated (high humidity)\n**High VPD** = The air is dry and can absorb more moisture\n\n## Why VPD Matters for Plants\n\nPlants \"breathe\" through tiny pores called stomata on their leaves. Through these stomata, plants:\n- Take in CO2 for photosynthesis\n- Release oxygen\n- Transpire (release water vapor)\n\nThe rate of transpiration is directly controlled by VPD. Here's what happens at different VPD levels:\n\n### Low VPD (< 0.4 kPa)\n\nWhen VPD is too low, the air is nearly saturated with moisture. Plants struggle to transpire because there's nowhere for the water vapor to go.\n\n**Problems:**\n- Nutrient uptake slows (nutrients travel with water through the plant)\n- Weak, stretchy stems\n- Increased risk of mold and mildew\n- Calcium deficiencies (calcium requires transpiration to move)\n\n### Optimal VPD (0.8-1.2 kPa)\n\nIn this sweet spot, plants transpire efficiently without stress.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Strong, healthy growth\n- Efficient nutrient transport\n- Natural pest resistance\n- Optimal photosynthesis\n\n### High VPD (> 1.5 kPa)\n\nWhen VPD is too high, the air is very dry and pulls moisture from plants aggressively.\n\n**Problems:**\n- Stomata close to conserve water\n- Photosynthesis slows or stops\n- Wilting and leaf curl\n- Nutrient burn (concentrated nutrients as water is lost)\n\n## VPD Recommendations by Growth Stage\n\n| Growth Stage | Recommended VPD | Why |\n|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Seedling/Clone | 0.4-0.8 kPa | Delicate roots can't supply water fast |\n| Vegetative | 0.8-1.0 kPa | Support rapid growth |\n| Early Flower | 1.0-1.2 kPa | Promote flowering |\n| Late Flower | 1.2-1.5 kPa | Reduce mold risk |\n\n## How to Calculate VPD\n\nDon't worry - SYSGrow calculates VPD automatically! But here's the basic formula:\n\n```\nVPD = SVP × (1 - RH/100)\n```\n\nWhere SVP (Saturation Vapor Pressure) depends on temperature.\n\n## Practical Tips for Managing VPD\n\n### To Lower VPD:\n- Increase humidity (humidifier, wet towels, more plants)\n- Decrease temperature\n- Reduce air circulation slightly\n\n### To Raise VPD:\n- Decrease humidity (dehumidifier, increase ventilation)\n- Increase temperature slightly\n- Improve air circulation\n\n## The VPD Sweet Spot\n\nRemember: there's no single \"perfect\" VPD. The ideal range depends on:\n- Plant species\n- Growth stage\n- Light intensity\n- CO2 levels\n\nUse VPD as a guide, but always observe your plants. They'll tell you if conditions are right!\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. VPD measures the air's \"drying power\"\n2. Too low = mold risk, weak growth\n3. Too high = plant stress, closed stomata\n4. Optimal range is 0.8-1.2 kPa for most plants\n5. Adjust based on growth stage\n\nStart monitoring VPD today with SYSGrow, and watch your plants thrive!"

      "content": "# Optimal Light Schedules for Indoor Growing\n\nLight is the engine that drives plant growth. Getting your light schedule right can mean the difference between a mediocre harvest and an abundant one.\n\n## Understanding Photoperiods\n\nPlants respond to the length of day and night - this is called the **photoperiod**. Different plants have different requirements:\n\n### Day-Neutral Plants\nThese plants flower based on age, not light schedule:\n- Tomatoes\n- Peppers\n- Most herbs\n\n### Short-Day Plants\nThese need long nights (short days) to flower:\n- Cannabis\n- Chrysanthemums\n- Poinsettias\n\n### Long-Day Plants\nThese need short nights (long days) to flower:\n- Spinach\n- Lettuce (to prevent bolting)\n- Onions\n\n## Recommended Light Schedules\n\n### Seedlings: 16-18 hours\nSeedlings benefit from long days to establish themselves. Gentle light prevents stretching while promoting healthy growth.\n\n**Recommended schedule:** 6:00 AM ON - 10:00 PM OFF\n\n### Vegetative Growth: 18-24 hours\nMost plants grow fastest with maximum light exposure during this stage.\n\n**Options:**\n- 18/6 (18 hours on, 6 hours off) - most common, gives plants rest time\n- 20/4 - for aggressive growth\n- 24/0 - controversial, some plants benefit, others need rest\n\n### Flowering: 12/12\nFor photoperiod-sensitive plants, equal day and night triggers flowering.\n\n**Important:** Avoid any light leaks during the dark period! Even brief interruptions can stress plants or prevent flowering.\n\n## Setting Up Light Schedules in SYSGrow\n\nSYSGrow makes light automation easy:\n\n1. Go to **Devices** in the sidebar\n2. Find your light actuator\n3. Click **Add Schedule**\n4. Choose **Photoperiod** type\n5. Set hours of light (e.g., 18)\n6. Set \"lights on\" time (e.g., 6:00 AM)\n7. Save and enable\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n### Simulate Sunrise/Sunset\nAbrupt light changes can stress plants. Consider:\n- Using dimmers with gradual ramp-up\n- Having some lights come on/off at different times\n\n### Match Light to Growth Stage\nUpdate your schedule as plants progress:\n- Seedling → Vegetative: Increase intensity gradually\n- Vegetative → Flowering: Switch to 12/12 (if photoperiod-sensitive)\n\n### Consider Light Quality\nDifferent spectrums suit different stages:\n- Blue light (5000-6500K): Vegetative growth\n- Red light (2700-3000K): Flowering\n- Full spectrum: All stages\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### 1. Light Leaks During Dark Period\nEven small amounts of light can prevent flowering. Check for:\n- LED indicator lights\n- Gaps in grow tent zippers\n- Light from other rooms\n\n### 2. Inconsistent Schedules\nPlants have internal clocks. Changing schedules frequently causes stress.\n\n### 3. Not Enough Dark Time\nEven day-neutral plants benefit from some darkness. The dark period allows plants to:\n- Respire and recover\n- Move sugars from leaves to roots\n- Regulate hormones\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA well-planned light schedule is one of the easiest ways to improve your indoor garden. Let SYSGrow handle the automation while you focus on what matters - growing healthy, productive plants!"

      "content": "# Reading Your Soil Moisture Sensor\n\nSoil moisture sensors are invaluable tools, but their readings can be confusing. Is 40% wet or dry? What's optimal for your plants? Let's demystify soil moisture readings.\n\n## Types of Soil Moisture Sensors\n\n### Resistive Sensors\n**How they work:** Measure electrical resistance between two probes. More water = less resistance.\n\n**Pros:** Cheap, widely available\n**Cons:** Probes corrode over time, affected by soil salinity\n\n### Capacitive Sensors\n**How they work:** Measure dielectric constant of soil. Water changes the capacitance.\n\n**Pros:** No corrosion, more accurate, last longer\n**Cons:** More expensive\n\n## Understanding the Numbers\n\nMost sensors report a percentage (0-100%), but what do these numbers mean?\n\n### 0-20%: Very Dry\n- Soil is parched\n- Most plants will show stress\n- Water immediately for most plants\n\n### 20-40%: Dry\n- Good time to water most plants\n- Succulents and cacti prefer this range\n- Many plants start showing slight wilt\n\n### 40-60%: Ideal Range\n- Perfect for most vegetables and herbs\n- Good balance of moisture and oxygen\n- Roots can breathe while accessing water\n\n### 60-80%: Wet\n- Recently watered\n- Good for seedlings\n- Too wet for drought-tolerant plants\n\n### 80-100%: Saturated\n- Recently irrigated or overwatered\n- Risk of root rot\n- Reduce watering frequency\n\n## Plant-Specific Recommendations\n\n| Plant Type | Ideal Range | Notes |\n|------------|-------------|-------|\n| Tomatoes | 40-60% | Consistent moisture prevents blossom end rot |\n| Lettuce | 50-70% | Shallow roots need consistent moisture |\n| Herbs | 30-50% | Most prefer slightly drier conditions |\n| Peppers | 40-55% | Let dry slightly between waterings |\n| Succulents | 10-30% | Very drought tolerant |\n\n## Placement Matters\n\n### Depth\n- Place sensor at root level (usually 2-4 inches deep)\n- Too shallow: readings fluctuate with surface drying\n- Too deep: won't detect when topsoil is dry\n\n### Location\n- Near plants, not in empty soil\n- Consistent distance from emitters/drippers\n- Multiple sensors for large areas\n\n## Calibrating Your Sensor\n\nFor accurate readings, calibrate your sensor:\n\n1. **Dry Reading:** Let sensor dry completely in air (0%)\n2. **Wet Reading:** Place in glass of water (100%)\n3. **Configure in SYSGrow:** Enter these values as calibration points\n\n## Automated Irrigation\n\nSYSGrow can automate watering based on soil moisture:\n\n1. Set your dry threshold (e.g., 35%)\n2. Set your wet threshold (e.g., 60%)\n3. Pump turns ON when below dry threshold\n4. Pump turns OFF when reaching wet threshold\n\nThis ensures plants always have optimal moisture without overwatering!\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Readings Always High\n- Check sensor isn't touching roots\n- Verify probe isn't in standing water\n- Consider soil compaction\n\n### Readings Always Low\n- Ensure good contact with soil\n- Check for air pockets around sensor\n- Verify sensor is working (test in water)\n\n### Readings Jump Around\n- Secure connections\n- Shield wires from interference\n- Increase averaging in SYSGrow settings"

      "content": "# Automating Your Grow: Getting Started\n\nAutomation isn't just for commercial operations. With SYSGrow, even home growers can benefit from reliable, consistent plant care.\n\n## Why Automate?\n\n### Consistency\nPlants thrive on routine. Automation ensures:\n- Lights turn on at exactly the same time every day\n- Watering happens when needed, not when you remember\n- Temperature stays within optimal range 24/7\n\n### Peace of Mind\nGoing on vacation? Working long hours? Automation means:\n- Plants are cared for when you're away\n- Alerts notify you of problems\n- You can check in from anywhere\n\n### Better Results\nAutomation often outperforms manual care:\n- No overwatering from uncertainty\n- No light schedule mistakes\n- Optimal conditions maintained around the clock\n\n## The Building Blocks\n\n### Sensors (The Observers)\nSensors collect information about your environment:\n- **Temperature sensors** - Air temperature\n- **Humidity sensors** - Relative humidity\n- **Soil moisture sensors** - Water content in growing medium\n- **Light sensors** - Light intensity (lux)\n- **CO2 sensors** - Carbon dioxide levels\n\n### Actuators (The Workers)\nActuators take action based on commands:\n- **Relays** - Control pumps, fans, lights\n- **Dimmers** - Adjust light intensity\n- **Motorized vents** - Control airflow\n\n### SYSGrow (The Brain)\nSYSGrow connects everything together:\n- Reads sensor data\n- Makes decisions based on your rules\n- Controls actuators\n- Alerts you to problems\n\n## Automation Levels\n\n### Level 1: Time-Based Schedules\n**Complexity:** Simple\n**Requirements:** Just actuators\n\nExamples:\n- Lights on at 6 AM, off at midnight\n- Pump runs for 60 seconds every 4 hours\n- Fan runs during \"day\" hours only\n\n### Level 2: Interval Schedules\n**Complexity:** Moderate\n**Requirements:** Actuators\n\nExamples:\n- Mister sprays 30 seconds every 2 hours\n- Circulation fan runs 5 minutes every 30 minutes\n- Nutrient doser runs brief cycle daily\n\n### Level 3: Sensor-Triggered Actions\n**Complexity:** Advanced\n**Requirements:** Sensors + Actuators\n\nExamples:\n- Pump turns ON when soil moisture < 35%\n- Exhaust fan activates when temp > 28°C\n- Humidifier runs when humidity < 50%\n\n### Level 4: Smart Automation\n**Complexity:** Expert\n**Requirements:** Multiple sensors + Actuators\n\nExamples:\n- VPD-based climate control\n- Adaptive lighting based on DLI\n- ML-predicted irrigation\n\n## Your First Automation\n\nLet's set up a simple light schedule:\n\n### Step 1: Connect Your Light to a Relay\nPlug your grow light into a relay-controlled outlet connected to SYSGrow.\n\n### Step 2: Add the Actuator in SYSGrow\n1. Go to **Devices**\n2. Click **Add Actuator**\n3. Name it (e.g., \"Main Light\")\n4. Configure GPIO pin or MQTT settings\n5. Save\n\n### Step 3: Create a Schedule\n1. Find your actuator in the list\n2. Click **Add Schedule**\n3. Choose **Simple** schedule\n4. Set ON time: 6:00 AM\n5. Set OFF time: 12:00 AM (midnight)\n6. Enable and save\n\nCongratulations! Your light now runs automatically!\n\n## Adding Sensor Triggers\n\nOnce you're comfortable with schedules, add sensor-based control:\n\n### Soil Moisture Irrigation\n\n1. Set up a soil moisture sensor\n2. Configure a pump actuator\n3. Create a **Condition** schedule:\n   - Trigger when soil moisture < 35%\n   - Stop when soil moisture > 60%\n   - Add minimum interval between runs (prevents rapid cycling)\n\n### Temperature-Based Exhaust\n\n1. Set up a temperature sensor\n2. Configure exhaust fan actuator\n3. Create a condition schedule:\n   - Turn ON when temperature > 28°C\n   - Turn OFF when temperature < 25°C\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Start Simple\nBegin with time-based schedules. Add complexity gradually as you learn how your system responds.\n\n### Test Manually First\nBefore enabling automation, manually test each actuator to ensure it works correctly.\n\n### Set Safety Limits\n- Maximum run times for pumps\n- Minimum intervals between activations\n- Manual override capability\n\n### Monitor and Adjust\nCheck your logs regularly. Adjust thresholds based on:\n- Plant response\n- Seasonal changes\n- Growth stage changes\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Over-Automating Too Soon\nStart with one or two automations. Add more once those are working reliably.\n\n### Ignoring Sensor Placement\nA sensor in the wrong place gives wrong readings. Place sensors where they represent actual plant conditions.\n\n### Not Having Backups\nWhat happens if a sensor fails? Consider:\n- Manual override options\n- Alert thresholds\n- Backup sensors for critical systems\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomation doesn't have to be complicated. Start with simple schedules, learn how your system behaves, and gradually add sophistication. Your plants - and your schedule - will thank you!"
