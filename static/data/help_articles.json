          "content": "# VPD Explained\n\nVapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) is one of the most important metrics for plant health, yet it's often overlooked.\n\n## What is VPD?\n\nVPD measures the \"drying power\" of the air - how much moisture the air can still absorb. It's calculated from temperature and humidity.\n\n**Formula:** VPD = (Saturation Vapor Pressure) - (Actual Vapor Pressure)\n\nDon't worry - SYSGrow calculates this automatically!\n\n## Why VPD Matters\n\nPlants transpire (release water vapor through their leaves) based on VPD:\n\n- **Low VPD (< 0.4 kPa):** Air is nearly saturated. Plants can't transpire well, leading to:\n  - Nutrient uptake problems\n  - Increased disease risk\n  - Weak stems and leaves\n\n- **Optimal VPD (0.8-1.2 kPa):** Perfect balance for:\n  - Healthy transpiration\n  - Efficient nutrient transport\n  - Strong growth\n\n- **High VPD (> 1.5 kPa):** Air is very dry. Plants transpire too fast:\n  - Stomata close to conserve water\n  - Photosynthesis slows down\n  - Wilting and stress\n\n## Optimal VPD by Growth Stage\n\n| Stage | VPD Range | Temp/Humidity Example |\n|-------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Seedling/Clone | 0.4-0.8 kPa | 25°C / 70% RH |\n| Vegetative | 0.8-1.0 kPa | 26°C / 60% RH |\n| Early Flower | 1.0-1.2 kPa | 26°C / 55% RH |\n| Late Flower | 1.2-1.5 kPa | 24°C / 50% RH |\n\n## How to Adjust VPD\n\n**To lower VPD (increase humidity or decrease temperature):**\n- Use a humidifier\n- Reduce ventilation\n- Add more plants\n- Lower temperature\n\n**To raise VPD (decrease humidity or increase temperature):**\n- Use a dehumidifier\n- Increase ventilation\n- Raise temperature slightly"

          "content": "# Calibrating Your Sensors\n\nAccurate sensor readings are crucial for proper plant care. Here's how to calibrate your sensors.\n\n## When to Calibrate\n\n- When you first install a sensor\n- If readings seem inaccurate\n- After sensor firmware updates\n- Periodically (every 3-6 months)\n\n## Temperature Sensors\n\n### What you need:\n- A reliable reference thermometer\n- Time for sensors to stabilize (10-15 minutes)\n\n### Steps:\n1. Place your reference thermometer near the sensor\n2. Wait for readings to stabilize\n3. Compare readings\n4. If different, go to **Devices** > Select sensor > **Calibration**\n5. Enter the offset value (reference - sensor reading)\n\n## Humidity Sensors\n\n### Salt Test Method:\n1. Place sensor in sealed container with saturated salt solution\n2. Wait 8-12 hours\n3. Reading should be 75% RH\n4. Adjust calibration offset if needed\n\n**Note:** Most modern humidity sensors are factory-calibrated and rarely need adjustment.\n\n## Soil Moisture Sensors\n\n### Two-point calibration:\n1. **Dry reading:** Let the sensor dry completely in air\n2. Note the reading (this is your 0% or \"dry\" point)\n3. **Wet reading:** Place sensor in a glass of water\n4. Note the reading (this is your 100% or \"wet\" point)\n5. Enter these values in the sensor calibration settings\n\n## pH Sensors\n\n### Using calibration solutions:\n1. Rinse probe with distilled water\n2. Place in pH 7.0 buffer solution\n3. Calibrate to 7.0\n4. Rinse and place in pH 4.0 buffer\n5. Calibrate to 4.0\n6. Rinse and store properly\n\n**Important:** pH sensors require regular calibration (weekly for heavy use) and proper storage in electrode storage solution."

Check your internet connection\n2. Refresh the page\n3. If the server is on Raspberry Pi, ensure it's powered and connected\n4. Check if the SYSGrow service is running\n\n## \"Sensor Not Responding\"\n\n**Cause:** A sensor isn't sending data.\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check physical connections (GPIO, I2C, etc.)\n2. Verify power supply to the sensor\n3. Check sensor configuration in Devices page\n4. For MQTT sensors, verify broker connection\n5. Restart the sensor or device\n\n## \"Failed to Save Settings\"\n\n**Cause:** The server couldn't save your changes.\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check your internet connection\n2. Refresh the page and try again\n3. Check browser console for specific errors\n4. Verify you have permission to change settings\n\n## \"Database Locked\"\n\n**Cause:** SQLite database is busy (rare).\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Wait a few seconds and retry\n2. Restart the SYSGrow server\n3. Check for runaway processes accessing the database\n\n## Page Not Loading / Blank Screen\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)\n2. Try a different browser\n3. Disable browser extensions\n4. Check browser console (F12) for errors\n\n## Slow Performance\n\n**On Raspberry Pi:**\n1. Reduce sensor polling frequency\n2. Limit number of browser tabs\n3. Check CPU/memory usage with `htop`\n4. Consider reducing data retention period"

Power off the Raspberry Pi\n2. Verify all wires are securely connected\n3. Check for loose or damaged connections\n4. Ensure correct GPIO pin assignment\n5. Power on and test\n\n### Verify Configuration\n1. Go to **Devices** page\n2. Click on the offline device\n3. Confirm GPIO pin number is correct\n4. Check device type matches physical device\n\n## For MQTT Devices (ESP32)\n\n### Check Network Connection\n1. Verify ESP32 is powered on (LED indicator)\n2. Check if it's connected to WiFi\n3. Ping the device's IP address\n\n### Check MQTT Broker\n1. Verify MQTT broker (Mosquitto) is running\n2. Check broker logs for connection attempts\n3. Verify MQTT credentials are correct\n\n### Reset the Device\n1. Power cycle the ESP32\n2. Wait for it to reconnect (check broker logs)\n3. If still offline, check for firmware issues\n\n## For ZigBee Devices\n\n### Check ZigBee Network\n1. Verify ZigBee coordinator is online\n2. Check device pairing status\n3. Move device closer to coordinator if weak signal\n4. Re-pair device if necessary\n\n## Still Offline?\n\nIf device remains offline after troubleshooting:\n\n1. Check **System Health** page for more details\n2. Review system logs for error messages\n3. Test device independently (outside SYSGrow)\n4. Consider hardware failure if all else fails"

Sensor is disconnected but returning cached value\n2. Sensor is faulty\n3. I2C communication issue\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check physical connections\n2. Restart the SYSGrow server\n3. Test sensor with independent tool\n4. Replace sensor if faulty\n\n## Readings Fluctuating Wildly\n\n**Possible causes:**\n1. Loose connections\n2. Electrical interference\n3. Sensor placed in unstable environment\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Secure all connections\n2. Use shielded cables\n3. Move sensor away from electrical noise sources\n4. Increase averaging window in settings\n\n## Readings Seem Wrong\n\n**Possible causes:**\n1. Sensor needs calibration\n2. Wrong sensor type configured\n3. Unit conversion issue\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Calibrate the sensor (see Calibration guide)\n2. Verify sensor type in configuration\n3. Check temperature unit (Celsius vs Fahrenheit)\n4. Compare with known-good reference device\n\n## No Readings at All\n\n**For I2C sensors:**\n1. Check I2C is enabled on Raspberry Pi\n2. Verify correct I2C address\n3. Run `i2cdetect -y 1` to see connected devices\n\n**For GPIO sensors:**\n1. Verify correct GPIO pin number\n2. Check pull-up/pull-down resistor requirements\n3. Test with simple script outside SYSGrow\n\n**For MQTT sensors:**\n1. Check MQTT connection status\n2. Verify correct topic configuration\n3. Use MQTT client to see if data is being published\n\n## Soil Moisture Sensor Specific\n\n- Ensure sensor is fully inserted in soil\n- Check for corrosion on probes\n- Capacitive sensors are more reliable than resistive\n- Calibrate for your specific soil type"
